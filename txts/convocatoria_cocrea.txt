The document describes the rules and process of the 2023 open call for the incentive tax benefit established in article 180 of Law 1955 of 2019, modified by article 27 of Law 2277 of 2022. This call seeks to select artistic, cultural and heritage projects that contribute to promoting the exercise of cultural rights and meeting the strategic objectives defined by the Ministry of Culture.

The call has three participation modalities:

1. Projects with Own Contributions (PAP): Only for projects whose owner is the same contributor and whose ordinary income in 2022 does not exceed the limits to be considered micro, small or medium enterprises. The approval of the projects will be valid for 1 year.

2. Projects with Third Party Contributions (PAT): For projects whose owner has one or more investors or donors (contributors) who are income tax payers, interested in contributing money to the project. The approval of the projects will be valid for 1 year. 

3. Projects without Identified Contributor (PAI): For projects whose owner does not have an identified contributor. The approved projects will be available virtually on the CoCrea website, where they can be consulted by citizens and potential contributors. They will receive an Approval Certificate to facilitate their own management to obtain investments or donations. If after 18 months the owner cannot certify that he has identified contributors committed to making investments or donations covered by the incentive mechanism, the project will lose CoCrea's approval. CoCrea does not guarantee obtaining resources or contributors for projects approved in this modality.

To participate, natural or legal persons must meet requirements such as having at least 1 year of experience and a CIIU code related to arts, culture or heritage. Public entities may participate in any modality. The projects must be aimed at promoting cultural rights through art, culture and heritage. Five strategic axes and their objectives have been defined. Restrictions are established for each of the fields and subfields in which the projects can participate.

The projects must be formulated based on the cultural rights approach, considering their aspects (participation, access, contribution and interaction), dimensions and variables. They must also consider the conditions of cultural law (availability, accessibility, acceptability, adaptability and suitability).

In summary, the call seeks to promote cultural rights through the selection of art, culture and heritage projects that can receive incentive tax benefit. The projects will depend on the management of their owners to obtain resources and the call does not guarantee them.
